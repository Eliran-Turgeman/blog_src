Is there a point in writing anymore?
I rarely read other blogs, almost all the info, i get from an llm.

llms changed how i view writing.
the bar became higher - is it even worth writing about? what's the point?
but it also paralizes because I kinda lost the motivation to write.

but still, the act of writing i enjoy. and so maybe i just write for myself now, and that's ok.
