I haven’t posted anything in my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/booksbytes) since October 18, 2024. After creating that channel in late August—dedicated to sharing tech book summaries — I had every intention of posting regularly. 

I went on vacation in mid-October, announcing I’d be back in early November to continue.

Well, that never happened.

### A bit of background

On August 30, 2024, I launched the Telegram channel with a promise: “I’ll read tech books and share chapter-by-chapter summaries a few times a week.” I also published a reading list, hoping to keep a steady pace.

For a while, I did just that. But on October 18, 2024, I left for a two-week vacation, fully intending to resume my routine afterward. Instead, I found myself questioning everything about that routine.

Btw the vacation was awesome.

### Why I stopped?

During my vacation, I finally had some real downtime — enough to think about what actually makes me happy and how my everyday routine might not always align with those interests. It led me to one key realization:

> The obligation of summarizing every chapter was making me dread reading—something I usually love.

I wanted to grow my knowledge and stay consistent with my reading habit. But committing to “tech book summaries, multiple times a week” was far too rigid. It left no room for spontaneity or the simple joy of skipping boring sections. I’d unknowingly turned reading — my personal passion, into a chore.

### The student mindset trap
I had fallen into the "student trap" (I just made it up, don't know if it exists). I believed I had to absorb every single page of a book, as if preparing for an exam. But there’s no test at the end of these books—this is purely for my own growth and curiosity. I realized how pointless it was to force myself through chapters I wasn’t enjoying.

### What's next?
I’m ready to make a new (and more realistic) promise to myself—and to you:

> “I will read books that genuinely interest me. I’ll skim or skip the boring parts. And I’ll only share insights, summaries, or resources that I find worth reading”

Here’s what that means going forward:

* No more forced summaries. If a chapter doesn’t grab me, I’ll move on.
* Some weeks I might share multiple insights; other times, I’ll post less frequently while exploring a mix of technical books, plus interesting articles or blog posts.
* Expect shorter, more authentic recaps - no rigid breakdown of every single chapter. I’ll share what genuinely intrigues me or feels useful.

With this approach, I’m aiming to bring back the fun and spontaneity of reading while still sharing valuable takeaways, wherever they come from.
