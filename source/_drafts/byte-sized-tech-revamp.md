I haven’t posted anything in my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/booksbytes) since October 18, 2024. After creating that channel in late August—dedicated to sharing tech book summaries — I had every intention of posting regularly. 

I went on vacation in mid-October, announcing I’d be back in early November to continue.

Well, that never happened.

### A bit of background

On August 30, 2024, I launched the Telegram channel with a promise: “I’ll read tech books and share chapter-by-chapter summaries a few times a week.” I also published a reading list, hoping to keep a steady pace.

For a while, I did just that. But on October 18, 2024, I left for a two-week vacation, fully intending to resume my routine afterward. Instead, I found myself questioning everything about that routine.

Btw the vacation was awesome.

### Why I stopped?

During my vacation, I finally had some real downtime — enough to think about what actually makes me happy and how my everyday routine might not always align with those interests. It led me to one key realization:

> The obligation of summarizing every chapter was making me dread reading—something I usually love.

I wanted to grow my knowledge and stay consistent with my reading habit. But committing to “tech book summaries, multiple times a week” was far too rigid. It left no room for spontaneity or the simple joy of skipping boring sections. I’d unknowingly turned reading — my personal passion, into a chore.

Also, I read part of the books that were in popular demand, and I felt like I already learned the lessons included in them. Re-reading them just so I can summarize them felt pretty much useless for my own progression (which was my main goal to start this journey).

I understood that at the point of my career (after reading different tech books) I already had a good grasp of the principles and I was eager to apply them. I understood that my own progression will be mostly defined by the things I build.

### What's next?

All of this reflection helped me realize that real growth comes from actually building something. I’m still a fan of reading and will always have a stack of books by my side—but from here on, I want to focus on rolling up my sleeves and applying those lessons in practice.

That’s why I’m working on an early-access platform called 404skill—a place where we’ll tackle real-world coding projects, get feedback, and learn together by doing. It’s not about chasing every hot new framework or cramming a reading list; it’s about creating tangible work and honing the skills we already have.

I’d love for you to be part of it. Whether you’re looking to sharpen your coding skills, collaborate on projects, or just see what building in public looks like, sign up for early access and join me in this next chapter:

Thanks for sticking around and reading my thoughts.
