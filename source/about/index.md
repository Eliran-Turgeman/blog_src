Hey there! I'm Eliran, a backend engineer working on security products for the cloud. I’ve been building cloud security solutions for the past few years at Palo Alto Networks and now at Microsoft.

This blog is where I share things I’ve learned, projects I’ve built, and my thoughts on software engineering.

I mostly live in the world of APIs, infrastructure, and scalable systems. Outside of work, I take on freelance projects and help teams build solid backend foundations. If you're looking for someone to handle the backend so you can move faster—I'm probably your guy.

You can also check out my [portfolio](https://www.16elt.com/portfolio/) to see what I’ve been up to.
