I'm Eliran, a backend engineer working on container security @ Microsoft.

When things get too comfortable, my brain starts looking for a new puzzle. This season’s puzzle is a mix of CUDA and distributed training, just for fun.

Things I like:
- my wife
- coffee
- playing TFT
- cooking
- my dog (look at this cutie...)
<div style="text-align: left;">
  <img
    src="./ollie.jpg"
    alt="my dog"
    style="max-width: 300px; display: inline-block; margin: 0;"
  >
</div>
