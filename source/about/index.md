Hey there! I'm Eliran, a backend engineer working on security products for the cloud. I’ve been building cloud security solutions for the past few years at Palo Alto Networks and now at Microsoft.

This blog is where I share things I’ve learned, projects I’ve built, and my thoughts on software engineering.

I am currently building [404skill](https://404skill.github.io/#/), a platform that helps you level up as a software engineer.
