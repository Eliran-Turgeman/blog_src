I'm Eliran, a backend engineer from Israel working on application security @ Microsoft.

I am working on a book and/or course that will teach how to build a vulnerability scanner from scratch (see [books](https://www.eliranturgeman.com/books/)).


Things I love:
- my wife
- coffee
- playing TFT
- cooking
- my dog (look at this cutie...)
