Hi! I'm Eliran.

I work as a software engineer for Microsoft.
On this website, I am practicing my writing skills, and sharing stuff I build.

I created a [learning platform](https://sissues.github.io/) to improve your backend skills through real-world projects. It's OSS & free, so [check it out](https://sissues.github.io/)  :)
