Hey there! I'm Eliran, a backend engineer working on security products for the cloud. I’ve been building cloud security solutions for the past few years at Palo Alto Networks and now at Microsoft.

On this blog, I share things I’ve learned, projects I’ve built, and my thoughts on backend engineering.

I also run a [Telegram channel](https://t.me/booksbytes). I share tech-book summaries and curated blog posts I read. I'm reading some of the most impactful books for software engineers. I'm summarizing them into bite-sized pieces to share their key insights. If you're interested, check the [announcement here](https://www.16elt.com/2024/08/31/telegram-channel-announcement/) for details. Then, [join the channel](https://t.me/booksbytes) to stay updated!

Lastly, I created [Skill Issues Killer](https://sissues.github.io/). It's an open-source platform. It helps you sharpen your backend skills with real-world projects. It’s completely free, so if you’re serious about improving, [check it out!](https://github.com/sissues/cli)
