Alright, hereâ€™s the deal. I just kicked off a new Telegram channel called [***Byte-Sized Tech***](https://t.me/booksbytes). Why? Because Iâ€™m tired of skimming my way through tech books, and I figured, why not drag some of you along with me?

I've prepared a short reading list of books I am planning to read in the upcoming weeks/months:

- A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout

- Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann

- Dependency Injection in .NET by Mark Seemann

I will share chapter summaries in [***Byte-Sized Tech***](https://t.me/booksbytes) a few times a week while I read these books.

I don't want to commit to a certain number because reading and writing summaries take time. On days I don't post summaries, I'll share other readings. These will be interesting blogs or tech news.

To help you decide if this is for you, I share some interesting things I read last week. If they interest you, please join.

I am not doing this for altruism. I want to read and study consistently. I hope that doing it publicly, with accountability, will help me stick to it.

So, join us... [***Byte-Sized Tech***](https://t.me/booksbytes).
