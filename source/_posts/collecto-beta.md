Collecto is an open-source, self-hosted email collection solution built for those who demand full sovereignty over their data. No hidden fees, no forced lock-insâ€”just a straight-up tool to help you capture and manage emails on your terms.

### What makes Collecto different?

* __*Total Data Ownership*__
Host Collecto yourself and keep control of every email you gather. You decide how and where your data is storedâ€”no third-party lock-in.

* __*Effortless Integration*__
With a single endpoint and minimal JSON payloads, you can start collecting emails in minutes. No guesswork, no friction.

* __*Real Subscribers, No Spam*__
From reCAPTCHA verification to email confirmations, Collecto helps ensure you only get legitimate sign-ups.

* __*Open-Source Freedom*__
Inspect the code, adapt it to your specific needs, or contribute back to the community. Youâ€™re in the driverâ€™s seat.

* __*Customizable Templates*__
Deliver a polished, on-brand welcome email every time someone subscribes. First impressions matter.

### Coming soon: managed, hosted version

We know not everyone wants to self-host. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re building a fully managed version of Collecto. Sign up for [early access](https://trycollecto.github.io/) and youâ€™ll get:

* Automatic Updates: No more manual installations or patchingâ€”everything is handled for you.
* Layered Spam Defenses: We exclude disposable email providers, confirm addresses, and use reCAPTCHA so your list remains clean.
* Zero Maintenance: Focus on growing your audience rather than babysitting servers and deployments.

[Join the Early Access List](https://trycollecto.github.io/) to stay in the loop as we bring the managed Collecto experience online.


### How it works

All it takes is a `POST /api/EmailSignups` call with a simple JSON body:

```http
{
  "FormId": "...",
  "Email": "user@example.com"
}
```

Thatâ€™s it. Youâ€™ll have a secure, verifiable way to collect emailsâ€”without the complexity.

### Why beta?

Weâ€™re refining Collecto based on real-world feedback. By joining the beta, you help us:

* Validate our spam defenses and workflow.
* Spot any missing features or integration hurdles.
* Shape the upcoming managed version to fit what you actually need.

### Try Collecto

If self-hosting is your thing, grab Collecto from our [open-source repo](https://github.com/Eliran-Turgeman/Collecto). If youâ€™d rather let us handle everything, [sign up here for early access](https://trycollecto.github.io/) to the managed solution.

Thanks for checking out Collecto. Weâ€™re keeping it simple, transparent, and entirely user-focusedâ€”because your email list should be yours to shape, secure, and scale.
