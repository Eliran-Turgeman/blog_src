Over the past couple of weeks, I've been working on solving a problem that's been nagging me for a while. Whenever I wanted to launch something new or set up a waiting list, I couldn't find a simple, flexible, and free tool to collect emails. Most options out there are either too complicated, too restrictive, or come with features I just don't need. I also didn't want to pay anything.

So, I built Collecto.

Collecto is an open-source, self-hosted, lightweight email collection service. It gives you full flexibility and ownership without any unnecessary extras.

## Key Features:

- Multi-tenancy: Host multiple forms and tenants with isolated data and settings.
- Create Forms: Easily generate forms to collect user emails.
- Accept Signups: Securely capture form submissions and store them.
- Forms Dashboard: Manage, track, and analyze submissions from a simple interface.

If you're looking for an uncomplicated way to collect emails for your projects, give Collecto a try. It's free, flexible, and puts you in control.
