I created a **free & open-source** [platform](https://github.com/sissues) to learn/improve backend skills through API projects.

## What is it?

- It is not a small puzzle you can solve in a few lines of python / js.
- It is not highly curated - You have the project specification, and a test suite - you have to make the tests pass in whatever tech you choose.
- It is trying to resemble "real-world" work - the projects specs are written in steps, so that they rely on each other - you will need to think how to modularize your code correctly so it is easily extensible.
- It is highly flexible - Write your code in whatever language & framework.

Note: In order to achieve high flexibility, you will have to write a Dockerfile specifying how to run your API - don't be intimidated if it's your first time working with Docker - I wrote a [guide](https://github.com/sissues/cli/blob/main/docs/getting_started_with_docker.md) on how to tweak the Docekrfile template you'll get.

## Contributions

If you are interested in adding a new project to the platform - follow the contribution [guide](https://github.com/sissues/cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you are having any issues/suggestions/questions/whatever... you can [contact me ](https://www.16elt.com/about/)

Looking to make this platform as useful as it can be, so I encourage you to send over some feedback!
