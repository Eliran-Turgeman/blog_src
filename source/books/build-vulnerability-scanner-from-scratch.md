## Synopsis

Vulnerability scanners are common in development workflows. They impact CI pipelines, influence releases, and produce artifacts for compliance and security. Yet, many engineers find the inner workings of these tools unclear.

This book focuses on building a vulnerability scanner from scratch. It's not only about recreating tools. It’s also about knowing the design limits that impact vulnerability detection.

This book looks at how scanners work. They take in artifacts and build dependency lists. Then, they interpret version information and match these lists with external vulnerability data. Finally, they create structured results that remain relevant over time. 

The aim is not to create the most complete scanner or mimic any commercial product. This book focuses on creating a system with clear assumptions.

By the end, readers will have a working vulnerability scanner with all the core features. They will also understand what this system can and cannot know.

This book is for engineers. It’s for those who build or manage security tools, CI/CD systems, or use vulnerability data. It expects you to have some experience with backend systems.
