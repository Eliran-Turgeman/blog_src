## Why Mentorship?
Information is everywhere, but it's easy to get lost. Sometimes, you don't need more courses or books. You need someone who's been there and can guide you, saving you from pitfalls and enhancing your growth.

## What You Get With Me:
* ***Raw Feedback***: I won't sugarcoat. You'll get the genuine feedback needed to improve.

* ***Industry Navigation***: There's more to software than coding. Learn how to navigate the politics, the dynamics, and the endless cycle of tech trends.

* ***Job Prep***: Real talk about resumes, interviews, and what employers are actually looking for.

* ***Practical Code Reviews***: Your code needs more than just "it works". Let's optimize it together.

## What I Expect From You:
Commitment.

## Interested?
Great. Let's not waste time. Reach out, and let's get started.
